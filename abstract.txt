Credit card fraud is a complex problem that has significant consequences for both consumers and financial institutions. 
In this project, we aim to use data science techniques to detect credit card fraud. The project will involve collecting and 
preprocessing transaction data, including features such as time of transaction, amount, and location. Data exploration 
and visualization techniques will be applied to uncover patterns and correlations in the data. Machine learning algorithms, 
such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, will be used to train and evaluate models for fraud detection. 
The goal of this project is to develop a fraud detection system that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions and helps 
prevent financial losses for both consumers and financial institutions. The results of this study will contribute to the field 
of data science and have practical applications for financial institutions and payment processing companies.
